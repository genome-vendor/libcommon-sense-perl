Description: unknown
 “Nothing is more fairly distributed than common sense: no one thinks
 .
 he needs more of it than he already has.”
 .
 – René Descartes
 .
 common::sense implements some sane defaults for Perl programs, as defined by
 two typical (or not so typical - use your common sense) specimens of Perl
 coders. In fact, after working out details on which warnings and strict modes
 to enable and make fatal, we found that we (and our code written so far, and
 others) fully agree on every option, even though we never used warnings
 before, so it seems this module indeed reflects a "common" sense among some
 long-time Perl coders.
 .
 The basic philosophy behind the choices made in common::sense can be
 summarised as: "enforcing strict policies to catch as many bugs as possible,
 while at the same time, not limiting the expressive power available to the
 programmer".
 .
